                At our Barista101 Training Academy, we believe that the key to a great cup of coffee is the person
                behind the machine - the Barista. That's why we've dedicated ourselves to providing the highest quality
                Barista101 training for those who want to learn the art of making delicious espresso-based drinks.
                <br /><br />With over 30 years of experience in the coffee industry, our team of expert Barista's is
                passionate about sharing their knowledge and skills with the next generation of coffee professionals.
                Our one-day basic Barista101 course is designed to teach trainees everything they need to know to make
                great coffee, from brewing techniques to milk steaming and frothing, to latte art and equipment
                maintenance. <br /><br />We understand that in order to make great coffee, you need to use the best
                products. That's why we only use top-of-the-line products such as Espresso Roma coffee and Melt'd
                powders products in
                our training program. This ensures that our trainees are equipped with the knowledge and tools they need
                to become some of the best Barista's in the world. <br /><br />At the end of our course, trainees
                receive a Certificate of attendance that recognizes their completion of the course and gives them the
                confidence to apply for coffee positions with top employers. <br /><br />Everyone loves a good-tasting
                coffee, and we believe that the best way to achieve that is by training the person who makes it - the
                Barista. Join us and learn the art of making an awesome espresso-based coffee!
